# SYNC.md — Alphanomy Whitelabel Overlay

This repo is a whitelabel overlay on top of the `Alphab2bapp` upstream. The
canonical contract for whitelabel forks is in
`docs/WHITELABEL_RECIPE.md` (mirrored from upstream). Read that first if
you're new here.

## Upstream

- **Repo**: `https://github.com/.../Alphab2bapp` (local clone at
  `/home/pk/Alphaquark_docs/AlphaQuark/codes/github/Alphab2bapp`)
- **Tracked branch**: `feature/sdk-plus-config_forkv2`
- **Last sync attempt**: 2026-05-09 — content port (not git merge), see
  § "Sync history" below.

## ⚠️ This fork has unrelated git history with upstream

`git merge-base feature/prince upstream/feature/sdk-plus-config_forkv2`
returns no merge base. This repo was not created by `git clone` from
Alphab2bapp — it was seeded as a fresh repo containing a copy of an old
upstream snapshot. As a result:

- The canonical `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/<branch>` from
  `WHITELABEL_RECIPE.md` will **NOT** work here. Git would need
  `--allow-unrelated-histories` and would conflict on every shared file.
- Until this is fixed (rebuild the fork as a real clone of upstream — see
  § "Long-term: rebuild as a real fork"), syncs happen by **content port**:
  read upstream's diff, port the relevant edits manually onto matching
  files here.
- Do not rely on `git log feature/prince..upstream/...` for "what's coming
  in from upstream" — the histories are unrelated, so `git log` shows
  every upstream commit as "new".

## What this fork contains

Per the recipe contract, an overlay should contain:

1. `designs/alphanomy/` — variant-specific tokens, composites, screens,
   assets (currently 13 screens + 2 composites + the tokens bundle).
2. `designs/alphanomy/assets/` — variant-local logo PNGs.
3. `designs/alphanomy/tokens/assets.js` — variant override of the
   `DEFAULT_ASSETS` slot. Wired into `tokens/index.js` re-exports.
4. A 2-line patch on `designs/registry.js` adding the variant import +
   map entry.
5. Native shell delta — Android/iOS icons, `applicationId`, build number,
   signing config, splash, display name, deep-link scheme.
6. `.env` with `DESIGN_VARIANT=alphanomy` (or equivalent).
7. This `SYNC.md`.

## Known gap — `useTokens()` is not yet variant-aware upstream

`src/theme/useTokens.js` (upstream) imports the default builders directly.
It does **NOT** consume the variant's `tokens.buildAssets` even when
`DESIGN_VARIANT=alphanomy`. This means:

| Surface | Renders correctly when DESIGN_VARIANT=alphanomy? |
|---|---|
| `designs/alphanomy/screens/*` (variant overrides — Login, Signup, Home, etc.) | YES — they're the variant's own screens. |
| `designs/default/composites/BasketCard.js` (falls through if not overridden) | NO — calls upstream's `useTokens().assets.logoFadedPng` which returns the AlphaQuark logo, not Alphanomy. |
| `designs/default/screens/ChangeAdvisor.js` (default fall-through) | NO — same reason. |
| `src/components/SplashScreen.js` (renders pre-providers) | NO — direct require of `src/assets/logo.png` which was reverted to AlphaQuark. |
| `src/components/HomeScreenComponents/PlanCard.js` | NO — direct require of `src/assets/logo.png`. |
| `src/UIComponents/RebalanceAdvicesUI/RebalanceCard.js` | NO — direct require of `src/assets/fadedlogo.png`. |
| `src/utils/Config.js` (`SharedDefaultLogo` / `AlphaQuarkLogo`) feeding `configData.logo` | NO — direct imports. |

**The proper fix is upstream**: make `useTokens()` consume variant tokens
via the `DesignProvider` instead of importing default builders directly.
Until then, the alphanomy variant's runtime appearance will be a mix of
alphanomy-branded surfaces (variant-overridden screens) and AlphaQuark-
branded surfaces (default fall-through, plus the variant-blind `src/`-side
consumers above).

This is a known and accepted regression of the 2026-05-09 cleanup compared
to the previous state, where the fork worked around the gap by overwriting
shared `src/assets/*` files. That workaround was the leak — it broke the
default variant's appearance for anyone running `DESIGN_VARIANT=default` in
this repo. The cleanup trades a partial visual mix for a clean separation
that's ready to flip to fully variant-aware once upstream fixes
`useTokens()`.

## What this fork must NOT have

- A patch to `src/assets/*` — that breaks the default variant's
  appearance. Variant-specific images go under `designs/alphanomy/assets/`.
- Any `src/`-side patch that diverges from upstream behavior. If you find
  one, it belongs upstream as a generic improvement OR as a new
  variant-override mechanism that the fork then consumes. Do not
  perpetuate `src/`-side drift.
- A copy of `designs/default/` — fallback chain handles default flow-
  through automatically.
- Direct edits to the SDK package (`@alphaquark/mobile-sdk`).

## Sync workflow (today, until the rebuild)

Because `git merge` doesn't work without `--allow-unrelated-histories`,
sync by content port:

1. Identify the upstream branch tip and the time window of upstream commits
   you want to bring in.
2. For each upstream commit, read its diff (`git show <sha>` in the local
   `Alphab2bapp` clone).
3. Apply the same edits to matching files in this repo. **Skip** anything
   under `src/`-paths that this fork has variant-specific divergence on
   — but record it in this SYNC.md so the divergence is tracked.
4. Update the variant where needed (e.g. if a new viewModel field appears
   upstream that an alphanomy override should consume).
5. Commit with a message like `sync(upstream): port <commit-range> —
   <subject>` so future maintainers can trace.

## Long-term: rebuild as a real fork

The clean fix is to rebuild this repo as a proper git clone of upstream:

1. Save the variant deltas to a tarball: `designs/alphanomy/`,
   `designs/alphanomy/assets/`, the `designs/registry.js` patch lines,
   the native shell files (Android `mipmap-*`, `colors-icon.xml`,
   iOS `AppIcon.appiconset`, `applicationId` / `versionCode` lines from
   `build.gradle`, iOS `Info.plist` display name + bundle id), `.env`,
   this `SYNC.md`.
2. `rm -rf .git` and back up the working tree.
3. `git clone https://github.com/.../Alphab2bapp .` to seed a real fork
   with shared history.
4. Re-apply the saved deltas on top.
5. `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/pkc144/Alphanomy.git`,
   `git push --force-with-lease origin feature/prince` (destructive —
   overwrites the existing remote history; coordinate with anyone who
   has the repo cloned).

After the rebuild, the canonical `git fetch upstream && git merge` flow
from `WHITELABEL_RECIPE.md` works as designed. The 2-line conflict on
`designs/registry.js` becomes the only expected conflict per upstream
merge.

## Sync history

### 2026-05-09 — Whitelabel cleanup pass (content port, not git merge)

Brought over upstream Phases 1-3 of the whitelabel-sync work (commits
`6ddf946`, `66a3fa3`, `987f2b7`):

- **Phase 1 (Navigation.js wrapper hoist)** — already locally applied via
  this fork's commit `f30695a`. No change needed.
- **Phase 2 (logo asset-token slot)** — ported by content port:
  - `src/theme/assets.js` (new file, copied verbatim from upstream).
  - `src/theme/useTokens.js` — added `buildAssets` import + bundle entry +
    memo dep on `config.assetTokens`.
  - `designs/default/tokens/index.js` — re-export `DEFAULT_ASSETS` +
    `buildAssets`.
  - `designs/default/screens/{Login,Signup,ResetPassword}.js` — `renderLogo`
    refactor to take `defaultLogo` as a third arg, fed by
    `tokens.assets.logoPng`. Module-scope require removed.
  - `designs/default/screens/ChangeAdvisor.js` — `useTokens` import added,
    reads `tokens.assets.logoFadedPng`. Module-scope require removed.
  - `designs/default/composites/BasketCard.js` — same pattern.
- **Phase 3 (variant-overlay model)** — `docs/WHITELABEL_RECIPE.md`
  copied verbatim from upstream. `CLAUDE.md` got a pointer added to the
  doc table mentioning that this repo IS a whitelabel fork.
- **Asset revert** — Alphanomy's previous overwrites of
  `src/assets/AppLogo/logo.png`, `src/assets/logo.png`, and
  `src/assets/fadedlogo.png` reverted to upstream values. The original
  alphanomy-branded versions were preserved at
  `designs/alphanomy/assets/{logo,fadedlogo}.png` (md5 verified).
- **Variant tokens** — `designs/alphanomy/tokens/assets.js` (NEW) added
  re-exporting `DEFAULT_ASSETS` pointing at the variant-local PNGs.
  Re-exported from `designs/alphanomy/tokens/index.js`.

Outcome:
- Default-variant builds (`DESIGN_VARIANT=default`) now show AlphaQuark
  branding correctly (the leak is closed).
- Alphanomy-variant builds (`DESIGN_VARIANT=alphanomy`) show alphanomy
  branding for variant-overridden screens, AlphaQuark branding for
  default-fall-through composites and `src/`-side consumers (see § Known
  gap above). This regression vs the pre-cleanup state is intentional —
  the proper fix is upstream's `useTokens()` becoming variant-aware.

NOT done in this pass (deferred):
- Long-term repo rebuild (force-push of corrected git history).
- Upstream's `useTokens()` variant-awareness fix.
- Porting upstream's other ~47 commits between this fork's seed snapshot
  and current upstream HEAD.
